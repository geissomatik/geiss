WHAT IS GEISS?
--------------

   GEISS is sound-reactive eye candy for your computer.  It comes in
   two forms: one version is a screensaver for Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP/Vista
   and the other, a visualization plugin for Winamp.  Geiss uses hand-
   tuned x86 assembly language to reach blazing speeds, generating
   smooth and graceful realtime graphics... and it can hear whatever
   your computer hears and synchronize the graphics it generates to
   the sound you're hearing.  You can hook a microphone, stereo, TV,
   or anything into your sound card... you can also play an audio
   CD in your CD-ROM drive if you have the CD audio cable connecting
   it to your sound card.  Whatever the sound source, Geiss will
   create  a fluid, visual image that matches the sounds you're
   hearing.

   You've downloaded the Winamp plug-in version of Geiss.  If you
   don't know what "Winamp" or an "mp3" is, you've downloaded
   the wrong thing... go get the screensaver instead!



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
1. Microsoft DirectX 3.0 or later.
2. Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP/Vista.  
    (Should also work on NT4 with Service Pack 4.)
3. Pentium-200 or faster processor.  MMX is highly utilized if present.
4. Winamp (version 2.10 or later).





INSTALLING GEISS
----------------
1. Run the installer.
2. Start up Winamp.
3. If you told the installer NOT to set 'Geiss' as your default plugin,
    hit CTRL+K, select 'Geiss for Winamp' as your current visualization plugin,
    and hit 'Close'.
4. Start some music playing in Winamp.
5. Hit CTRL+SHIFT+K, or double-click on the little dancing bars that are part
    of the winamp window, to launch Geiss.
6. You can also configure Geiss by hitting ALT+K from Winamp.



***********************************
EXPLANATION OF NEW FEATURES IN 4.00
***********************************

1. PRESETS: these will allow you to save your favorite screens for later
   recall.  Items that are saved include the map #, its random parameters,
   the palette, the waveform, any extra effects that were running, and the
   wave scaling (j/k keys).  

   saving: once you get a screen to look how you want it, you need to
   press 3 keys - the right bracket ']', then the 2-digit number of the
   slot you want to save it in, from 00 to 99.  Use the keys above the 
   letters on your keyboard for this - NOT the numeric keypad.

   loading: hit the left bracket '[' key, then enter the 2-digit code.

   note that these presets are saved in the GEISS.INI file (which is
   in your Windows directory), so you can share them
   with other people if you want to.  The GEISS.INI file will be created
   automatically the first time you save a preset.  (If you're having
   trouble finding it, try 'enabling debug info' from the config panel,
   then running Geiss once.  Look at C:\G_DEBUG.TXT.  In the first few
   lines it will give you the full path & filename to your INI file).

   WARNING: don't mess with the numerical parameters in the file, it's 
   likely to crash your system, and it's your own responsibility.


2. CUSTOM MESSAGES: you can now chuck your favorite sayings up on the 
   screen and watch them fade away.

   To show a custom message while Geiss is running, hit 'M', then enter
   the two-digit code of the message.  For example: to show number 3, 
   type 'M03'.

   However, you first have to program your messages.  You can place
   them in GEISS.INI in the [CUSTOM MESSAGES] section.  GEISS.INI
   can be found in your Windows directory.  If it
   doesn't exist, go ahead and create it.  If the [CUSTOM MESSAGES]
   section does not exist, go ahead and create it too.  It needs to
   look something like this:

        [CUSTOM MESSAGES]
        MESSAGE 0=This is Geiss 4.0
        MESSAGE 1=This program rocks.
        MESSAGE 99= ---  Welcome to Mecca  ---

   ...except you can make the messages say whatever you want.  The
   message numbers range from 0 to 99.  


3. DIRECTLY ACCESSING THE MAPS: there are now a total of 25 maps,
     numbered 1 through 25, all accessible by a 2-key command string.
     The command string is simply the two digits to make up the
     map number.  You must use the keys from 0 to 9 at the TOP of
     your keyboard - not from the numeric keypad.  For single-digit
     maps (1-9), pad them with a zero.  For example, to select map 12,
     you would enter '1' then '2'.  For map 5, you would press '0'
     then '5'.  You can press 'ESC' after the first digit to cancel
     the map selection.  (Pressing it again will exit.)


4. RATING SYSTEM:  Do you have any screens that you just hate?  Or some
   you really, really love?  Wouldn't you like a rating system where
   you could rate each screen, in order to control how frequently it
   gets randomly chosen?  Now you can.

   When you're at the screen you want to rate, use the '<' and '>' keys
   to give it fewer or more 'stars,' respectively.  A screen can have
   anywhere from 0 to 5 stars.  Zero stars means it will never be
   randomly chosen, while 5 means that it will be chosen more often.
   (The formula is simple: the probability that a mode will be chosen
   is equal to that mode's rating, divided by the sum of all the modes'
   ratings.)

   If you give a mode zero stars, then the only way you'll ever see it
   again is by directly selecting it with the numbers at the top of your
   keyboard (or if you load a preset for that screen).



+-------------------------+
|   CONFIGURATION PANEL   |
+-------------------------+

This section describes the function of each control in the configuration panel.


Graphics Options:

  Video Mode - this dropdown box lets you pick what video mode you want to run 
      the screensaver in.  The lowest possible is 320 pixels by 200 pixels 
      (320x200).  The highest possible is 1024x768 for the screensaver and
      640x480 for the plugin.  In addition, you can select the color depth:
      8, 16, or 32-bit.  8-bit mode gives you 256 colors, and you can the color
      palette during the program with the 'p' key.  In 16-bit color, 65000 
      colors are available, but the 'p' key has no effect.  In 32-bit color, 
      16.7 million colors are available.  The hicolor modes (16 and 32-bit)
      are substantially slower because 3 buffers must be processeds (one for 
      each red, green, and blue channel) whereas in 8-bit mode only 1 buffer
      must be processed.  Also, 16-bit mode is further slowed for technical
      reasons (three 8-bit values must be clipped & shifted into one 16-bit
      value for every pixel of every frame).  MMX is used to the highest
      possible extent in all screen functions, bit-chomping, and memory moves.

      The default video mode is 640x480x8.

      Newer video cards will be able to enumerate all their video modes, so
      everything on the list is a video mode that will work for you.  Older
      video cards don't have this capability; in this case, ALL possible video
      modes are listed.  Some will not work.  If you select one and try to
      run the program, and it reverts to the default video mode, then your
      video card can't handle that mode.  Try a different one.



  SLIDERS

  Vertical screen size - this lets you set what percentage of the screen is 
      filled by graphics.  You can set it from 30% to 100%.  A setting near 
      50% or 60% creates a nice letterbox effect.  The entire width of the 
      screen is always used; this just sets the vertical size.  Higher settings
      are proportionally slower.

  Frames between screen changes - this lets you set how many frames will display
      between map (screen) changes.  While you watch one map or screen in the 
      program, the next one is being generated in the background, and when it
      is finished, it immediately takes effect (unless you lock the screen with
      the 'L' key).  A lower setting will make the program slightly slower because
      larger chunks of the map will have to be generated each frame.  A setting of
      about 300-400 is recommended.

  Frame idle delay - set this to 0 (zero) if you want maximum speed out of the
      program.  However, if you like the resolution you're at and the animation
      is too fast, set this to 10 milliseconds or so.  The program will then 
      pause every frame for this many milliseconds and let Windows or Winamp 
      do its processing, and you'll see slower, smoother animation.  After
      getting the screen dimensions & color depth set to your tastes, if you're
      getting more than 30 frames per second, adjust this slider so that you
      only get 30 frames per second.  Trust me - it will look better!

  Use coarse palettes - this lets you set how often a 'coarse palette' is used.
      This only applies to 8-bit color modes.  A 'coarse palette' has a rough
      band in the dark area of the palette; this brightens up the screen and 
      heavily accentuates the dither patterns.  

  Use solar palettes - this lets you set how often a 'solar palette' is used.
      This only applies to 8-bit color modes.  A 'solar palette' has soft, 
      repeating bands of color in it.  The non-monotone nature of these palettes
      is their sale point.

  8-bit gamma correction - if the screen is too dark for you, crank this up.
      This only applies to 8-bit color modes.

  Default wave scaling - you can use the j/k keys during the program to scale
      the amplitude of the sound waves down & up, respectively.  If you always
      find yourself scaling them to a certain size every time you start the
      program, you can adjust this slider so that they start there automatically.
      However, it is highly recommended you adjust Windows' volumes (for the
      screensaver) or Winamp's volume (for the plugin) before doing this.  
      These volumes should always be set to 50% (halfway) for optimal results.

  Random song title popups - this slider lets you pick how often the song
      titles should randomly pop up on the screen.  If the "suppress
      song title popups" option is on, this slider will have no effect.


Sound Options:
  
  Sound input device - the only option here is Winamp.

  Suppress 'press h for help' message - every time you move the mouse, the 
      program pops up a message that says something like 'press h for help - 
      ESC/click to exit'.  If this bugs you, use this checkbox to turn it
      off.

  Suppress song title popups - whenever the song changes, Geiss will
      pop the new song name up on the screen for a fractional second
      and then let it blur into the background.  To disable song title
      popups, check this box.

  Minimize Winamp before running [FIXES FLICKER] - this will minimize
      Winamp's main window while Geiss is running.  This saves CPU time
      (as Winamp is not trying to redraw itself) and alleviates problems
      where Winamp tries to paint over the DirectDraw surface (Geiss)
      (this is the "flicker").  If you have problems with Winamp not
      being accessible after Geiss is run (i.e., it couldn't be un-
      minimized properly), try disabling this checkbox.  Otherwise,
      leave it on.

  Generate debug info in c:\g_debug.txt - if you're having problems or think you've
      found a bug, enable this checkbox and run the program until the bug occurs.
      Then e-mail the file c:\g_debug.txt to me, along with a description
      of the bug.  Helpful information to include is your operating system, 
      version, Winamp version (if using the plugin), machine speed, RAM, how 
      many and what other programs were open, version of DirectX, whether or not
      the problem happens every time, etc.




TIPS
----
1. You should try all the video modes listed to see which one looks
    and runs best on your system; there are vast differences between
    them, in image quality, speed, and color depth.  8-bit color modes
    are recommended for their superior speed/efficiency.
2. If you really want to squeeze out a higher frame rate, minimize
    other applications before running Geiss.  This can also help
    to reduce choppiness.
3. 'GEISS' rhymes with 'ice'.  It starts with a hard 'g' sound, as in
    'gastrocnemius'.
4. Don't miss the help screen - press 'h' to turn it on/off at any
    time.
