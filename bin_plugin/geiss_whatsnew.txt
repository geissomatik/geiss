
What's New in Geiss vX.XX (XX/XX/XXXX)
----------
1. License changed to be Software Libre and Open Source under
   the 3-Clause BSD License.


What's New in Geiss v4.29 (6/20/2009)
----------
1. Default video mode selection now matches whatever your primary monitor is set to.
2. On config panel, the video mode list is now sorted.
3. On advanced config panel, changed 'frames between mode switches' to 
    'seconds between mode switches', and made the new range from 1..60 
    seconds.  Also fixed the saving of this value (in 4.28, there was a 
    bug, and it wouldn't save the value if you changed it).


What's New in Geiss v4.28 (10/4/2008)
----------
1. In VS2003 project settings, switched from multi-threaded DLL 
    to multi-threaded (oops)... was causing an unnecessary MSVCR71.DLL 
    dependency, which some systems do not have.


What's New in Geiss v4.27 (9/12/2008)
-------------------------------------
1. added support for multiple monitors!
    -select which monitor from the config panel
    -geiss will run on that monitor, and you can work freely in the other(s)
2. added instructions to the config panel on how to run with live input, 
    as well as a button to run 'sndvol32 /r' for you.
3. default video mode is now 32-bit (was 8-bit), and the 32-bit modes now 
    say "[recommended]" next to them, instead of the 8-bit ones.
4. we now clear the edges on one of the main buffers [front or back - it 
    will alternate] every 11 frames, so if you're working on another 
    monitor and something accidentally paints over part of the visualizer 
    window, it'll be gone within a second or less.
5. fixed bug where waveform #1, with really loud music, could sometimes 
    draw pixels just beyond the bottom line of the screen, which would 
    cause them to bleed into the image [at least, in modes such as mode 6].
6. duration (and frequency, if randomization is on) of song title popups 
    is now sync'd to the framerate.
7. fixed bug where pausing the music would sometimes cause song title popup 
    to appear with " - Winamp [Paused]" at the end of the song title.
8. tuned some spatial and temporal settings on the Grid effect so that it 
    looks nicer at fast framerates and/or higher resolutions.  (Looks the 
    same at old/slow/low framerates/resolutions.)
9. when you start Geiss, or when you start the config panel, or (when 
    on the config panel) select a new monitor while it is up, it now auto-
    finds the closest match to the previously-selected resolution and color 
    depth, if the exact match can not be found.  (Rather than just giving you
    an error and quitting, in the case of running the plugin; or selecting 
    some lazy default, for the config panel.)
10. removed the 'minimize winamp' option from plugin (not necessary)


What's New in Geiss v4.26 (8/23/2008)
-------------------------------------
1. added 'S'huffle and 'R'epeat toggle keys to plugin version.
2. *plugin* no longer flashes the help message at you when you move the mouse.
3. made waveform colors richer in >8bpp modes
4. 'shifting' effect now runs correctly at >30 fps.  (it got a bit spastic before.)
5. default 'frames_til_auto_switch' is a little longer now.
6. fixed a bug in 8-bit modes where last ~256 pixels on last scanline weren't updating.
7. when you set it to use 100% of the screen, it now uses a bit more (before it was actually like 96%;
     now it's about 98%.  My sincere apologies, but I just don't have time to revamp it all to use 100%...
     trying to do what I can in limited time...)
8. we no longer call DrawText() on the front buffer.  (Embarrassing... I know... I was
     *very* new to programming and graphics back in '98!)  This was causing problems on
     some machines whenever you tried to draw text.
9. increased the chromatic dispersion on the 'bar' effect ('u' key), and slowed it down a bit,
     for 32-bit modes.
10. worked on the chasers a bit - slowed them down in high-fps situations, and they new draw more dots
     when the res. is high (proportional to the resolution), so the overall feel is the same.
11. default mode preferences (ratings) now biased so that modes 5-9 show up more often (4 stars)
     than the others.  Mode 15 shows up less often (2 stars).  (Defaults only)
12. in mode 6, you now get swirlies more often.
13. worked around a compiler bug that was sometimes putting a flashing white dot in the upper-left corner.
     (had to move from VC++6 to VS2003 .NET; had to make sure processor was set to 'Blend' and Global Optimizations
     were off.)
14. disabled all message processing that might interfere with power functions (monitor turning off,
     sleep, etc).
15. some of the more colorful effects now show up a little more often, in hi-color modes; and the grid
     effect now shows up ~1% more often, in all modes.
16. mouse cursor is now hidden on every frame (...before, if you hit a winamp play/pause/etc key, 
     the cursor would show, and you'd have to wiggle the mouse to make it go away).
17. fixed aspect ratio of 'grid' effect
18. changed text color to a more pleasant yellow
19. moved the 'A' dots a little further away from the center of the screen when at larger resolutions.
20. [plugin only] if you try to run the plugin without music, it now gives you 
     a messagebox telling you why it's not going to work (instead of just leaving you 
     with a black screen, wondering why nothing is happening).


What's New in Geiss v4.25 (8/10/2008)
-------------------------------------
1. there are no longer any restrictions on screen resolution.  (Before, we had to
	write a separate loop for each possible res, because we were out of registers
	and couldn't hold that info in a register.  Now, the code just modifies itself
	to poke in the right variable into an immediate value in the code itself.)
2. the default resolution is now whatever your desktop is at.
3. when the framerate exceeds 30 fps, we now slow down the motion (per frame)
	so that it appears to be the same rate of motion as if you were running at 30
	fps - just smoother.
4. the overall image darkening-over-time rate (the sum of the 4 weights for bilinear 
	interpolation) is now tuned based on the # of pixels.  At high resolutions,
	there is very little loss (weightsum == 256), while at 800x600, the weights
	total about 253, and at low resolutions (320x240), it goes down as low as 251.
5. 'frames_til_auto_switch' is now actually adjusted to the current framerate, so,
	set its value as if the plugin/screensaver were going to be running at 30 fps,
	and it will do the right thing.  (This way, you don't have to mess with that
	value to correct for whatever fps you're getting.)
6. updated the waveforms to draw properly at higher resolutions, by smoothly upsampling
	(to 2X or 4X the # of dots).  This also keeps them nice and mostly-solid.
7. made a bunch of hte other little special effects work nicely at higher resolutions
	(that usually means fatter dots), for both 8-bit and >8-bit color.
8. wow - fixed a bug in the screensaver version that proves I hardly knew what a 
	thread *was* back in 1998.  Oops.  Keypresses are actually SAFE now!
9. also cranked up default wave brightness/scaling for the screensaver.


What's New in Geiss v4.24 (1/4/2000)
------------------------------------
1. updated web link (geisswerks.com) and e-mail address.
2. changed registry key from being housed in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
     to HKEY_CURRENT_USER.  
3. bug: maps 21+ weren't selectable; you can now access them directly
     using the following commands.  The symbol '#' stands for a key
     from 0 to 9 at the TOP of your keyboard - not from the numeric
     keypad.  Here are the command strings:
    
    -press '##' to select a mode directly (ex: mode 5 is entered as '05').
    -press 'm##' to select a custom message 
    -press '[##' to load a preset
    -press ']##' to save a preset
    -you can press ESC at any time to cancel an in-progress command.
    -pressing ESC again will exit.


What's New in Geiss v4.23 (12/27/99)
------------------------------------
1. FPS (frames-per-second) display was broken - fixed now.


What's New in Geiss v4.21 (12/25/99)
------------------------------------
1. updated the range of frequences that contribute to the
    red, green and blue colors in truecolor mode.  Received
    (valid) complaints about too much red... there should be
    a good balance now.


What's New in Geiss v4.20 (12/8/99)
-----------------------------------
1. in truecolor modes, the color of the wave is now synchronized
     to match the frequencies in the music.  Bass will show up as
	 red, mids as green, and treble as blue.
2. truecolor modes are now about 10% faster - special thanks to Allen Hansen
     for all his help!
3. added 9 new maps (#17-25)
4. added some new palettes 
5. improved beat detection (for 'shifting' effect)


What's New in Geiss v4.01 (6/3/99)
----------------------------------
1. fixed bug w/config panel's "use shifting effect" slider
2. fixed bug w/saver where it sometimes failed to autostart
      (WM_SYSKEYUP came in errantly on frame 0... now ignored)
3. plugin & saver now use GEISS.INI in your WINDOWS directory.
      (plugin previously used your winamp/plugins directory, which
	   was sometimes impossible to detect)
4. removed old usage of 't' key from help screen (no longer shows song title)
5. set default gamma correction to 10%.
6. screensaver no longer exits on mouse movement
7. some effects can now be controlled by moving the mouse 


What's New in Geiss v4.00 final (5/23/99)
-------------------------------
1. adjusted the spectrum analyzer to more uniformly show bass/treble (plugin only)
2. fps display is finally fixed
3. ADDED RATING SYSTEM FOR SCREENS.  See geiss.txt for usage (uses keys '<' and '>').
4. toned down the 'shifting' amount in the shifting effect.
5. removed call to getDXVersion(), because NT4/SP4 users were still getting the
      'ordinal 6 not found' message at times.  Hopefully, 99% of users will have
	  at least DirectX 3 or later, which should be all that is required now.
6. made the new 'beat detection' for wave brightness toggleable from the main
      config panel, since some people liked it more, and others preferred the old
	  mode.
7. config panel items now 'tab' in order.
8. fixed bug w/presets for mode 14 (on load, it always had a really huge rotation).
9. fixed bug w/presets where palette would load wrong 20% of the time


Other really great new features that were introduced in 4.0 beta:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. presets (see geiss.txt)
2. dynamic map shifting - maps can now 'scoot' to the beat (toggle with 'I' key)
3. screensaver supports passwords
4. 5 new maps
5. palette now lockable ('T' key).
6. can now suppress all text messages (see config panel) (for nightclub use)
7. ADDED CUSTOMIZEABLE MESSAGES (for nightclub or personal use - see geiss.txt)
8. added level trigger to screensaver (plugin already had it)
9. map now changes on strong beat (or times out if song is mellow)



What's New in Geiss v4.00 beta 2 (4/10/99)
--------------------------------

[plugin only... screensaver is not yet released]

NOTE: you will need Winamp 2.10 to get access to the new keys used in
      version 4.00 of the Geiss plugin.

1. added passwords to screensaver
2. added level trigger to screensaver
3. fixed bug in level trigger for plugin
4. added 5 new maps - access them directly via SHIFT-2 through SHIFT-6 keys
5. added presets - use '[##' to load and ']##' to save, where '##' is the
           two-digit preset number to load/save.  Can be from 00 to 99.
6. added a new waveform (oscilloscope X-Y mode)
7. added true Beat Detection... now, when a "beat" is detected in the music, 
     the wave brightness is more sharply linked to the beat volume, so the beats
     really come out.  When no beat is detected, you see flat color, to emphasize
     the waveform.
8. map now changes on beat (when beat detected)
9. further thinned out the DirectX code (QueryInterface).. could have fixed 
     NT DirectX problems.  ?
10. NOTE: plugin now requires Winamp 2.10 for extended map keys (SHIFT-1 through 
     SHIFT-0) to function.
11. added dymanic map modification (linked to beats), and checkbox for default
     setting of this feature, in config panel.  This can look REALLY cool.
12. added info about FULLSCREEN/EXCLUSIVE failure for plugin: "don't use
    DirectSound output from Winamp!  Use waveout!"
13. added palette locking ('T' key)
14. added option to suppress ALL text messages (for nightclub-type displays)
15. added customizable messages... place them in GEISS.INI like so: (range 0-99)
		[CUSTOM MESSAGES]
		MESSAGE 1=Hello Dad - I'm in Jail!
		MESSAGE 99= ---  Welcome to Club Vinyl  ---
    Edit GEISS.INI in your Windows directory (for the screensaver) or your
    PLUGINS directory (for Winamp).
    To show a custom message, hit 'M##' where '##' is the 2-digit number of the
     message.  (example: to show number 3, type 'M03')
16. hopefully fixed a bug where certain (bright) greyscale palettes would cause
      the song title popups to become a solid white block when they faded out.
17. made an 'advanced options' panel to thin out the config panel... added a few 
      sliders too.
18. added dynamic map shifting - VERY, VERY COOL.  Use the 'I' key to
      turn it on and off.  It only takes effect when a good beat is
      detected.  You can set thresholds for how sensitive it is from
      the config panel.


What's New in Geiss v3.61 (3/18/99)
-------------------------
1. fixed bug with CPU detection on older Cyrix processors (5x86's,
     I believe).  This bug was giving an error message that said
     'Geiss executed an illegal instruction.'
2. updated the disclaimer/license agreement/documentation to
     officially say that Geiss is 100% free.


What's New in Geiss v3.60 (3/4/99)
-------------------------
1. added Cyrix CPU detection and optimizations for Cyrix CPU's -
     should see a 20% core frame rate boost on these processors
     in 8-bit video modes.
<the rest of these are mostly minor bug fixes>
2. If the Windows CD player was running and you tried to
     invoke the screensaver w/the autostart CD option, it would
     freeze on frame 25 when it checked the status of the CD-ROM.
     Now it detects if another CD player program is open, and if so,
     it disables CD controls and warns you to close the other CD
     player. (screensaver only)
3. re-fixed bug w/hourglass in screensaver (oops!)
4. added color variance to song titles for hicolor modes.
5. Geiss should be better about not 'resizing' desktop icons
     or windows upon exit, but it's still not perfect
6. power management bug finally fixed... when Geiss is running and
     the system issues a request to shut off the monitor or go into
     standby mode, Geiss shuts off peacefully.
7. since only DirectX 3 is required since the last version, it now
     only checks as far as DirectX 3.  (no anticipated effect)
8. some folks were having trouble with the program just shutting off
     after awhile - this was because Windows would think a screensaver
     wasn't running and would try to invoke one (Geiss or another one).
     Geiss will now intercept that request and kill it.
9. map 3: fixed bug with fatal overflow in hi-res, hi-color maps
     (Geiss would exit whenever it randomly selected map #3)
10. fixed DDSCL_FULLSCREEN and DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE errors.
11. fixed bug w/400x300x8 display where every 5th group of 8 pixels
      mimicked the 8 pixels left of it - was using MMX regs 0, 1, 2,
      3, and 3. (oops)
12. sped up generation of map 6 substantially.
13. when help msg is on, FPS message is only 1 line now (no overwriting)
14. fixed bug w/24-bit color modes and songtitle popups (plugin only)
15. now if it finds DirectX version 0 it just prints a warning to the debug
     file and doesn't bother the user.  This seems to be a detection error,
     and DirectX is usually ok to run.
16. modified About box - removed picture, changed content.


What's New in Geiss v3.53 (2/17/99)
-------------------------
1. fixed a bug where the mouse cursor was sometimes visible while 
     the program was running.
2. increased the core speed by about 15%, with generous help from 
     the guys at Cyrix.  Cyrix users should anticipate Geiss v3.60, 
     coming soon, which will have complete optimization for Cyrix 
     processors.
3. removed the Dither modes
4. fixed the 24-bit display modes.
5. fixed bug in config panel w/saving the user's selection of sound 
     device.
6. added detail to debug file
7. limited video modes to max. of 1024x768, so people don't kill 
     their systems.  It can go higher, but for now, I'm capping it 
     there.
8. changed a few of the maps to be more high-speed
9. made maps more versatile so that more interesting ones can be 
     written in the future.
10. for plugin, fixed bug where the song # wasn't stripped off if
     the song # was 1000 or higher.
11. fixed bug w/staggered display of 400x300x8 video mode
12. removed the Mode X compatibility... was giving some people errors
     where SetCooperativeLevel failed (for DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE and
     DDSCL_FULLSCREEN).


What's New in Geiss v3.50 (2/6/99)
-------------------------
1. sped up 16-bit MMX and non-MMX blits
2. added spectrum analyzer effects to plugin
3. improved error message for DSERR_BADFORMAT error (a common one)
4. increased plugin max. res. from 640x480 to 800x600
5. debug file now enumerates all video modes when they run the config 
     panel
6. added Mode X support
7. fixed bug w/Winamp (when always on top) sitting on top of the 
     config panel
8. changed icon
9. now only requires DirectX 3 (as opposed to DirectX 5)... should 
     work on NT4 with Service Pack 3 now.
10. the plugin now (by default) minimizes Winamp when it runs, then
     restores Winamp when finished, so that the overhead of drawing
     Winamp's window is eliminated.  Also, this alleviates problems
     with Winamp drawing on top of the directdraw surface.
11. fixed bug w/Winamp window getting moved after Geiss was run.
12. removed registration info from about box; now all under the 
     "Legal" button.
13. fixed power management bug for screensaver... before it would
     freeze up if your power management tried to shut Geiss off...
     now it should work fine.
14. added detailed FPS info
15. added 24-bit modes.... but they were messed up.
16. added "autostart CD" option for screensaver
17. added slider-bar to plugin so you can set how often random song
     titles should pop up.
18. cleaned up exit code a lot (should make it more stable)
19. now only accepts certain discrete video modes that I've hardwired -
     before, it would let you pick some crazy video mode if your card
     supported it, but wouldn't run correctly in that mode.  They
     are now limited to the ones that are directly supported.
